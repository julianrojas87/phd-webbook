<p>I know, I know... it was about time. But as Ralph Waldo Emerson famously put
it: <em>“It’s not the destination, it’s the journey”</em>. And believe me, it has been a long but an
amazing one. A journey that started with a 9000 km trip from my native Colombia
to Belgium in 2017. I decided to cross the Atlantic Ocean, despite already living at
the better end of it (Caribbean, am I right?), leave everything and everyone that I
knew behind, and try to pursue my life-long dream of traversing the world. However,
I didn’t just decide to do a PhD to travel and see the world. That would not have
been very smart. The main motivation came from my previous academic experiences
during my master’s degree in the Universidad del Cauca. There I had the opportunity to have a first glimpse of what research was about, published my first papers,
attended my first international conference, and I loved it.</p>
<p>I looked hard and around for the opportunity to continue an academic career, hope-
fully in a top institution and next to top researchers, while working in industry in the
meantime. Almost 3 years after finishing my Master, the opportunity came on a random afternoon
at the office, while scrolling through Facebook. My friend and former
colleague at Universidad del Cauca, Leandro, posted about a PhD position at Ghent
University. He was already living in Belgium and was working at Ghent University, although in a different research group. So my first thank you goes to you compadre and
your very fortunate Facebook post that allowed me to apply to this PhD position and
kickstart this life changing adventure. (I promise that I don’t check social media while
at the office anymore. In any case Facebook stopped being cool a long time ago and I
am too old for TikTok). Funny story, while applying to the lab, my interviewers forgot
to account for the time difference between Colombia and Belgium and set an online
meeting at 5 am Colombian time. I happily took it because having to take it at the office
would have been way more awkward than scrolling Facebook, but as I was told later,
that situation reflected my commitment (which was real) and helped me get selected.</p>
<p>Coming all the way to Ghent was accompanied by a rollercoaster of emotions. I was
excited to start a new chapter in my life, but also scared of the unknown. One person
was and has always been there to help me navigate through all of this, whether it was
work-related or not. My next thank you needs to go to Pieter C., who has been present
at all the stages of this PhD, including the 5 am interview, but also receiving me at the
airport when I first landed in Belgium and giving me an immediate and slightly jet-lagged
tour around the best city in the world! Thank you Pieter for believing in me, for
giving me the opportunity to join KNoWS and specially for supplying me with a continuous
and endless amount of enthusiasm for everything we did and still do. I am very
grateful for all this time working together and for all the things I have learnt from you.</p>
<p>Joining KNoWS allowed me to meet a group of extremely talented people.
So talented, that it was inevitable to face harsh case of impostor syndrome shortly after
joining. But, I will never forget one day that I went to eat later than usual to Resto
De Brug alone. There I was, questioning my life choices, when coincidentally Ruben
V. walked in and joined me. He kindly asked how I was feeling so far in the lab and
that conversation leads to my next thank you. Thank you Ruben for giving me the
boost of confidence and motivation that I needed to keep going. But also for being
a continuous source of inspiration over these years.</p>
<p>While I am at it, I also want to thank all my past and current colleagues at KNoWS for
countless enriching conversations, smooth collaborations and nice moments. Thank
you Anastasia (I’ll get back to you, I promise 😛), Arthur, Beatriz, Ben, Brecht, Bryan-Elliott, Cristian, Danica, Dieter D., Dieter D. P., Dörthe, Dwight, Dylan, Elias, Els,
Esther, Femke, Gayane, Gerald, Gertjan, Gilles, Harm, Ieben, Jeroen, Jiao, Joachim,
Jonas, Jonni, Jos, Katrien, Kush, Laurens, Maarten, Mathijs, Martin, Miel, Patrick,
Pieter B., Pieter H., Raf, Ruben D, Ruben E., Ruben T., Shamz, Shehab, Sindhu,
Sitt Min Oo, Stijn, Sven, Thomas, Tom, Vidya, Wout and Wouter. A special thank
you to Erik who at the very beginning made possible my hiring at the lab and during
a large part of this PhD was acting behind the scenes to make sure that everything
was running smoothly. Thank you also to Kristof, Laura, Joke
and all the administrative staff at IDLab, UGent and imec.</p>
<p>As this book reflects, my PhD was only possible thanks to the help and support of
many people and to the work carried out over several projects and collaborations.
First of all, I want to thank specially all my examination committee members prof.
Filip De Turck, prof. Steven Verstock, prof. Marina Aguado, prof. Luis Daniel
Ibañez, prof. Pieter Bonte and Dr. Philippe Michiels for their time and effort in
evaluating this work, and the valuable feedback they provided. I want to thank all the
people that I had the pleasure to work with during these years. Specially to Oscar and
David, with whom I collaborated in my very first project at KNoWS and always have
a blast on every conference we attend together. To Pieter M., Han and Wout B., with
whom I worked in the Velopark project. To Marina, Polymnia, Ivo, Dragos, Ghis
and all the ERA team for trusting me and without whom certainly this PhD would
have not been possible. Bottom line, a big thank you to all the project partners and
co-authors I was lucky to work with during these years.</p>
<p>I also need to mention the person responsible for me having a never-ending urge to
keep on exploring the world, my mother Olga. From very early on she always worked
hard to keep on showing me how big and amazing the world was, and how much there
was to learn from it. At the same time my father Eduardo taught me the importance
of hard work and dedication, and how cool was to be the one that knew everything about almost anything. My brother Juan Sebastian was always my partner in crime and the source of many fun times.
Thanks for holding the fort. I love you all and I am very grateful for all the effort
and support you continue to give me. Thank you also to all my friends in Colombia,
Belgium and around the world. Most of you I don’t see very often,
but whenever we do it always feels like time didn’t go by.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank the most important person in my life, my love and partner in life,
Anastasia (I told you I’d get back to you 😉). If there is something
I will always be grateful to KNoWS, is for having met you.
A big part of the credit for this PhD certainly goes to you.
You had my back at all times, you were there to listen to me, to support me,
to motivate me, to inspire me. I am very lucky to have you in my life
and I am very grateful for all the love and happiness you bring me.
I love you, I love our family and I can’t wait to continue living my dream of
traversing the world, but this time by your side.</p>

<p>Data interoperability has been and continues to be an important open challenge both
in the public and private sector. The state of the art on interoperability, suggests
that a multidisciplinary approach, involving both technical and human coordination,
is needed in order to truly achieve interoperability within and across organisational
boundaries. In this direction, the Semantic Web vision was proposed more than two
decades ago. Thanks to well placed and previously agreed upon semantic data models,
the existence of intelligent agents that can reason across a Web of data would be made
possible, and thus automatically solve the interoperability challenge. Unfortunately,
this vision continues to be a dream to this day. However decentralised Linked Data
technologies, which are sourced from the efforts of the original Semantic Web vision,
are gaining traction despite their negative reputation and an increasing adoption can
be observed both in the public and private sector.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the European Union has been continuously advocating for
more interoperable systems and data, and has laid multiple legal frameworks (e.g., the
European Interoperability Framework, the Open Data Directive, the Interoperability
Act, among others) to promote and support the transformation of (public) organisations
and development of new digital services that are interoperable by design and
by default. In this landscape, the Transport domain is regarded as one of the key
sectors and high-value data sources by the EU where the efforts for interoperability
should be prioritised, given its direct impact on citizen life and on the fight against
global issues such as climate change.</p>
<p>The most recent technological trends, also sourced from EU initiatives such as
Data Spaces, go towards decentralised system infrastructures. Data Spaces recognise
the practical impossibility of centralising all the knowledge in one single place, and
aim to allow for sovereign, trustful and legally compliant governance of data assets
within and across organisations. This raises the need for interoperability solutions that
allow organisations to migrate legacy technology stacks and maintain data life cycles
(creation, publication and consumption) at low operational costs. Here, Linked Data
technologies are suited to provide a technical framework for reaching interoperability,
given their native decentralised nature sourced from the Web itself.</p>
<p>This PhD work studies the use of decentralised architectures based on Linked
Data technologies over 3 real-world use case scenarios coming from the transport sector,
namely (i) publishing bicycle infrastructure information for public use; (ii) public
transport route planning over the Web and; (iii) railways infrastructure data integration
for supporting route compatibility checks. Concretely I study the suitability of
Linked Data technologies to support practical solutions for use cases within these scenarios
and whether Linked Data technologies can be adopted for production-ready systems.
The challenges studied in this work include, the feasibility of creating
decentralised Web applications using modern and developer friendly frameworks over
semantically described Linked Data, and analysing the scalability and limitations of
Linked Data based solutions and their capabilities to achieve automated data integration
that facilitates interoperability.</p>
<p>The main contributions of this dissertation include the provision of evidence on
the use and adoption of Linked Data technologies as an interoperable solution for
real and important use cases in the transport domain. For instance, to this date
municipalities and 11 private organisations continue to use the Velopark solution that
supports the decentralised publishing and maintenance of semantically annotated
bicycle parking data in Belgium. Also the system architecture created for ERA to integrate
and publish a knowledge graph containing information about the European railway
infrastructure and authorised railway vehicles, motivated the agency to make Linked
Data technologies the default setting for new data endeavours. More importantly,
the ERA Vocabulary has been adopted as an official building block for the Common
European Mobility Data Space and as a reference data model in the EU legislation.</p>
<p>The main conclusion drawn from this PhD work is that Linked Data technologies
are ready for the real world. Practical (user-oriented) Web applications can be
created and supported over decentralised and cost-efficient architectures based on
Linked Data technologies. Examples of this can be seen in the case of the Velopark
user application for visualising and looking for bicycle parkings of specific characteristics,
and in the case of the route compatibility check application that allows to calculate
custom routes over the European railway network and assess its physical
and technical compatibility with given vehicle types, which is maintained by the EU Agency for
Railways. Both applications remain operational to this day. In this PhD work, we also
see that alternative design of data interfaces that aim for a more balanced
(computational) cost distribution among data publishers and consumers, are able to provide
scalable and cost-efficient technical solutions for interoperable data exchange. This is
evidenced in the study made in this work of Linked Data-based APIs for the case of
public transport route planning, whose foundational principles and results can also be
applied to other use cases, even outside the transport domain. However, additional
research is needed to overcome the observed limitations in terms of performance
when handling large volumes of data. For example, with more complex API designs
that allow for more granular access to particular and relevant, yet still cost-efficiently
published, data subsets for given queries. Lastly, it is important to note
that a common denominator observed throughout the different scenarios explored during this
PhD work, is the fact that the main obstacles for interoperability using Linked Data
technologies were not of technical nature but of human nature. Changing mindsets
of people in charge could prove to be more challenging than building the technical
solutions that provide interoperability across systems, although as this work shows, is
not impossible. The quick development of demonstrators that highlighted
the benefits of Linked Data technologies and at the same time showed that solutions could
be built in relatively short time spans and at low costs, proved to be the key asset to
overcome this type of human-made obstacles.</p>
<p>Future work should focus on the development of technical specifications
that allow for low-cost and flexible data exchange architectures
that overcome the limitations of the data dump vs query API dichotomy.
This should be complemented by ways to describe data sources, not only at a metadata level,
but also at a granular content level in a way that enables applications
to autonomously discover and efficiently select sources relevant for their queries,
thus moving us a step closer to the original Semantic Web dream.
Also, multiple challenges will arise when trying to provide functional
solutions for all the required dimensions, necessary to accomplish the vision of Data
Spaces based on Linked Data technologies.</p>
