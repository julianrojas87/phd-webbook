# Summary

Data interoperability has been and continues to be an important open challenge both in the public and private sector. The state of the art on interoperability, suggests that a multidisciplinary approach, involving both technical and human coordination, is needed in order to truly achieve interoperability within and across organisational boundaries. In this direction, the Semantic Web vision was proposed more than two decades ago. Thanks to well placed and previously agreed upon semantic data models, the existence of intelligent agents that can reason across a Web of data would be made possible, and thus automatically solve the interoperability challenge. Unfortunately, this vision continues to be a dream to this day. However decentralised Linked Data technologies, which are sourced from the efforts of the original Semantic Web vision, are gaining traction despite their negative reputation and an increasing adoption can be observed both in the public and private sector.

In the last decade, the European Union has been continuously advocating for more interoperable systems and data, and has laid multiple legal frameworks (e.g., the European Interoperability Framework, the Open Data Directive, the Interoperability Act, among others) to promote and support the transformation of (public) organisations and development of new digital services that are interoperable by design and by default. In this landscape, the Transport domain is regarded as one of the key sectors and high-value data sources by the EU where the efforts for interoperability should be prioritised, given its direct impact on citizen life and on the fight against global issues such as climate change.

The most recent technological trends, also sourced from EU initiatives such as Data Spaces, go towards decentralised system infrastructures. Data Spaces recognise the practical impossibility of centralising all the knowledge in one single place, and aim to allow for sovereign, trustful and legally compliant governance of data assets within and across organisations. This raises the need for interoperability solutions that allow organisations to migrate legacy technology stacks and maintain data life cycles (creation, publication and consumption) at low operational costs. Here, Linked Data technologies are suited to provide a technical framework for reaching interoperability, given their native decentralised nature sourced from the Web itself.

This PhD work studies the use of decentralised architectures based on Linked Data technologies over 3 real-world use case scenarios coming from the transport sector, namely (i) publishing bicycle infrastructure information for public use; (ii) public transport route planning over the Web and; (iii) railways infrastructure data integration for supporting route compatibility checks. Concretely I study the suitability of Linked Data technologies to support practical solutions for use cases within these scenarios and whether Linked Data technologies can be adopted for production-ready systems. The challenges studied in this work include, the feasibility of creating decentralised Web applications using modern and developer friendly frameworks over semantically described Linked Data, and analysing the scalability and limitations of Linked Data based solutions and their capabilities to achieve automated data integration that facilitates interoperability.

The main contributions of this dissertation include the provision of evidence on the use and adoption of Linked Data technologies as an interoperable solution for real and important use cases in the transport domain. For instance, to this date municipalities and 11 private organisations continue to use the Velopark solution that supports the decentralised publishing and maintenance of semantically annotated bicycle parking data in Belgium. Also the system architecture created for ERA to integrate and publish a knowledge graph containing information about the European railway infrastructure and authorised railway vehicles, motivated the agency to make Linked Data technologies the default setting for new data endeavours. More importantly, the ERA Vocabulary has been adopted as an official building block for the Common European Mobility Data Space and as a reference data model in the EU legislation.

The main conclusion drawn from this PhD work is that Linked Data technologies are ready for the real world. Practical (user-oriented) Web applications can be created and supported over decentralised and cost-efficient architectures based on Linked Data technologies. Examples of this can be seen in the case of the Velopark user application for visualising and looking for bicycle parkings of specific characteristics, and in the case of the route compatibility check application that allows to calculate custom routes over the European railway network and assess its physical and technical compatibility with given vehicle types, which is maintained by the EU Agency for Railways. Both applications remain operational to this day. In this PhD work, we also see that alternative design of data interfaces that aim for a more balanced (computational) cost distribution among data publishers and consumers, are able to provide scalable and cost-efficient technical solutions for interoperable data exchange. This is evidenced in the study made in this work of Linked Data-based APIs for the case of public transport route planning, whose foundational principles and results can also be applied to other use cases, even outside the transport domain. However, additional research is needed to overcome the observed limitations in terms of performance when handling large volumes of data. For example, with more complex API designs that allow for more granular access to particular and relevant, yet still cost-efficiently published, data subsets for given queries. Lastly, it is important to note that a common denominator observed throughout the different scenarios explored during this PhD work, is the fact that the main obstacles for interoperability using Linked Data technologies were not of technical nature but of human nature. Changing mindsets of people in charge could prove to be more challenging than building the technical solutions that provide interoperability across systems, although as this work shows, is not impossible. The quick development of demonstrators that highlighted the benefits of Linked Data technologies and at the same time showed that solutions could be built in relatively short time spans and at low costs, proved to be the key asset to overcome this type of human-made obstacles.

Future work should focus on the development of technical specifications that allow for low-cost and flexible data exchange architectures that overcome the limitations of the data dump vs query API dichotomy. This should be complemented by ways to describe data sources, not only at a metadata level, but also at a granular content level in a way that enables applications to autonomously discover and efficiently select sources relevant for their queries, thus moving us a step closer to the original Semantic Web dream. Also, multiple challenges will arise when trying to provide functional solutions for all the required dimensions, necessary to accomplish the vision of Data Spaces based on Linked Data technologies.
